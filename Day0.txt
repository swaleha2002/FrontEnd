FRONTEND 70 DAYS CHALLENGE

 Day 0: Starting with the Basics of Internet!
1. How does the internet work?  Imagine a massive network of computers connected by cables and satellites. When you visit a website, your computer sends a request (like asking a question) to another computer (server) that stores the website's data. The server then sends back a response (the answer), which your browser interprets and displays as the website you see.

2. What is HTTP?   HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's a set of rules computers use to communicate with each other on the internet. HTTP defines how data is formatted, sent, and received, ensuring everything runs smoothly.

3. What is a domain name?   Think of a domain name as your website's unique address on the internet. It's the user-friendly name you type into your browser (e.g., [invalid URL removed]) instead of a complex server IP address (e.g., 142.250.184.196).

4. What is hosting?   Hosting is like renting space online for your website's files and data. Hosting companies store all the website's code, images, and content, making it accessible to anyone who visits your domain name.

5. What is DNS and how does it work?   DNS stands for Domain Name System. It acts as a giant phonebook for the internet. When you type a domain name, your computer doesn't understand it. The DNS translates the domain name into the server's IP address, allowing your computer to find and connect to the website's location.

6. Browsers and how do they work?    Browsers are the software programs used to access websites (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). They interpret the website's code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and display it in a visually appealing way on your screen.
